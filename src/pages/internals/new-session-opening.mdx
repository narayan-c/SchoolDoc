2. You must have at least one notebook from the last year that still has some empty pages. Bring one such notebook with you tomorrow for doing
warm-up activities.

पिछले साल की आपकी कोई ऐसी नोटबुक ज़रूर होगी जिसमें कुछ खाली पन्ने बचे होंगे। कल ऐसी ही एक नोटबुक अपने साथ लाएं।

3. Bring your pencils/pens, erasers and pencil colors/crayon colors to do some creative activities at school.

कल स्कूल में कुछ क्रिएटिव एक्टिविटीज़ करने के लिए अपनी पेंसिल/पेन, इरेज़र और पेंसिल कलर/क्रेयॉन कलर लाना न भूलें।

We are looking forward to see you tomorrow.

Warmly,

Parishkaaram Public School
:::


+ On the first day every subject teacher will
   - Start with some icebreaker activities (introduction, stories, games, drawing) to make students comfortable in the class.
   - Make them count the pages in their subject notebook and write the pledge on the first page.
   - If time permits then do some subject specific warm-up oral activities (not written)
+ In the last two periods assigned teachers will teach them how to bind their notebooks with newspaper and making their name chits from white papers.
+ In the month of April, M.A.(Theatre) students from the University will prepare a play with the students of classes 5-8 in last two periods.
+ After finishing the teaching duties at 1:20, PTDA (Planning and Teachers' development activities) is planned for the remaining time. During this, all the teachers will sit together
to present 5 minutes summary of their teaching experience of the day in the meeting.
  - Every teacher should address the following points in that meeting. (Use of english in communication is strongly recommended. This will help everyone to improve their communication skill.)
    - Class, subject, number of students present
    - Topic covered for every class
    - Share a specific example of something that went well in your class. This could be student engagement, participation, understanding of a concept, or a fun activity.
    - Share a general observation about your class or an area where you feel the lesson could be improved. (e.g., pacing needs adjustment, need for additional practice problems, unclear explanation).
    - End your presentation with a question for the group. This could be seeking suggestions for improvement, sharing ideas for similar situations, or simply sparking discussion.
  - Actively listen to colleagues' presentations and participate in the discussion.
  - Every week one facilitator will be moderating the discussion to keep the discussions on track and ensures everyone gets a chance to share.
  - Focus on Solutions: Frame the discussion around identifying solutions or strategies for improvement, rather than dwelling on challenges.
  - Positive & Collaborative: Maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere where everyone feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other.
