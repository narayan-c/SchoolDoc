This notebook has <span>&#x5f;&#x5f;&#x5f;&#x5f;&#x5f;</span> pages. I promise to take good care of it. I will not tear off any page and will write neatly and carefully.

2. You must have at least one notebook from the last year that still has some empty pages. Bring one such notebook with you tomorrow for doing
warm-up activities.
3. Bring your pencils/pens, erasers and pencil colors/crayon colors to do some creative activities at school.

We are looking forward to see you bright and early tomorrow! It is going to be a fantastic year!

Warmly,
